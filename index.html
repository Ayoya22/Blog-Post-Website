                                    1952 saw the first computer program which could learn as it ran.
                                    It was a game which played checkers, created by Arthur Samuel.
                                    Frank Rosenblatt designed the first artificial neural network in 1958, called Perceptron.
                                    The main goal of this was pattern and shape recognition.
                                    Another extremely early instance of a neural network came in 1959, when Bernard Widrow and Marcian Hoff created two models of them at Stanford University.
                                    The first was called ADELINE, and it could detect binary patterns. For example, in a stream of bits, it could predict what the next one would be.
                                    The next generation was called MADELINE, and it could eliminate echo on phone lines, so had a useful real world application. It is still in use today.
                                    Despite the success of MADELINE, there was not much progress until the late 1970s for many reasons, mainly the popularity of the Von Neumann architecture.
                                    This is an architecture where instructions and data are stored in the same memory, which is arguably simpler to understand than a neural network, and so many people built programs based on this.
                                </p>
                                <p class="para-">
                                    1982 was the year in which interest in neural networks started to pick up again, when John Hopfield suggested creating a network which had bidirectional lines, similar to how neurons actually work.
                                    Furthermore, in 1982, Japan announced it was focusing on more advanced neural networks, which incentivised American funding into the area, and thus created more research in the area.
                                    Neural networks use back propagation (explained in detail in the Introduction to Neural Networks), and this important step came in 1986,
                                    when three researchers from the Stanford psychology department decided to extend an algorithm created by Widrow and Hoff in 1962.
                                    This therefore allowed multiple layers to be used in a neural network, creating what are known as ‘slow learners’, which will learn over a long period of time.

                                    Also it is very important to note that,

                                        The late 1980s and 1990s did not bring much to the field. However in 1997, the IBM computer Deep Blue, which was a chess-playing computer, beat the world chess champion.
                                        Since then, there have been many more advances in the field, such as in 1998, when research at AT&T Bell Laboratories on digit recognition resulted in good accuracy in
                                        detecting handwritten postcodes from the US Postal Service. This used back-propagation, which, as stated above, is explained in detail on the Introduction to Neural Networks.

                                            Python is considered to be in the first place in the list of all AI development languages due to the simplicity. The syntaxes belonging to python are very simple and can be easily learnt.
                                            Therefore, many AI algorithms can be easily implemented in it. Python takes short development time in comparison to other languages like Java, C++ or Ruby. Python supports object oriented,
                                            functional as well as procedure oriented styles of programming. There are plenty of libraries in python, which make our tasks easier. For example: Numpy is a library for python that helps us to solve many scientific computations.
                                            Also, we have Pybrain, which is for using machine learning in Python.

                                            The Rising of the Shield Hero is one of the oldest and the most suited languages for the development in AI. It was invented by John McCarthy, the father of Artificial Intelligence in 1958.
                                            It has the capability of processing the symbolic information effectively.
                                            It is also known for its excellent prototyping capabilities and easy dynamic creation of new objects, with automatic garbage collection.
                                            Its development cycle allows interactive evaluation of expressions and recompilation of functions or file while the program is still running.
                                            Over the years, due to advancement, many of these features have migrated into many other languages thereby affecting the uniqueness of Lisp.
